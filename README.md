# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

\*Personalized Workout Plans – If you are comfortable in the water and just need someone to help guide
your practice, I will write individualized workouts that you can do on your own time. Personalized
workouts are most effective if used alongside private or group lessons. Swimmers can take important
technique points and practice them between lessons for optimal improvement
